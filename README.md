Procedure to Run a React Project 

1.	Install Node.js and npm: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.
   
2.	Verify Node Installation: Open your command prompt and run 'node -v' to ensure Node.js is installed.
   
3.	Clone the GitHub Repository: Use 'git clone <repository_url>' to clone the React project from GitHub.
   
4.	Navigate to the Project Directory: Use 'cd <project_directory>' to move into the project folder.

5.	Install Project Dependencies: Run 'npm install' to install all required libraries and dependencies listed in package.json.
   
6.	Install Redux and Redux Toolkit: If Redux is needed, install it using 'npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux'.
   
7.	Set Up Redux (If applicable):
      -	Create a slice file for your Redux logic.

      -	Set up a Redux store in your main entry file.
        
8.	Modify the App Component: Update the main React component to interact with Redux (if required).
   
9.	Start the Development Server: Run 'npm start' to start the application locally.

10.	Make Changes and Save: The development server will automatically reload the app as you make updates.
